# DO NOT modify any code in this class!
#    I wouldnt, but this shit is so bad I cant help myself.
#    Like you literally have a function called _print_maze that doesnt print the maze
#    Also you have default args that are mutable
#    And u literally seem allergic to any form of type hints
#    And also you keep intitializing instance variables in completely random places
#    Like.. I thought u were a java dev?? Doesnt java just not compile unless you initialize ur variables?
#    Actually wait i think it initializes them to null by default unless theyre `final``. Also now that im 
#    thinking abt it, iirc u were actually a Go dev. So it's probably *encouraged* to 
#    initialize things in random places.

#    TL;DR: this is why I hate the average python developer.

#    UPDATE: even AFTER adding type hints, this file still has EIGHT errors vs code is complaining about.
