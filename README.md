# CSE2050: Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design

**Term:** Spring 2023

**Instructor:** Prof. Jonathan Clark

**Course Objectives:**
1. Write programs in python using imports, functions, and object-oriented programming.
2. Compare data structures and algorithms based on time and space complexity and choose the correct ones for a given problem.
3. Implement abstract data types (stacks, queues, deques, mappings, priority queues) using various data structures (lists, linked lists, doubly linked lists, heaps, trees, graphs) and algorithms.
4. Use recursive algorithms to solve problems.
